# NNMusic-DatabaseProject

This Dababase Project "NN-Music" is proudly devised by Xie Jiaxuan, Jiang Zhenglan, Hu Yucheng.  
The project is based on the implementation of a database system using the openGauss database under the openEuler operating system, which is a major assignment for the undergraduate course on Database System Principles.  
This repository contains the front-end and back-end related to the database system, and ultimately uses the content of this database to implement a visual web page, with the relevant code provided for reference.
